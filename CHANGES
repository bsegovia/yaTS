yaTS 1.0.2
- Changed priority order. Now affinity and work stealing queue priorities are
  interleaved
- Implemented a clean and reactive way to yield threads when there is nothing
  to do
- Added proper load_acquire and store_release semantics

yaTS 1.0.1
- Fixed a possible race condition in the debug code
- Fixed a very stupid performance bug which leads the thread to sleep all the
  time when there is no worker threads...
- Renamed TaskScheduler::threadNum into TaskScheduler::workerNum. This is less
  confusing

Initial release
